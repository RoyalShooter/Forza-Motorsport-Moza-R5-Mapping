# Forza Motorsport Moza R5ES Mapping

A Forza Motorsport input mapping file for Moza R5ES, honestly this should come preinstall in the game. But since it is not, I decided to create one.

This file is moded from the original R9CS input mapping file to use for R5ES.

Shifter and Handbreak is not map for the current file, since I don't have that install on my rig right now and can't test for it. You can simply map it yourself by creating a new profile with my template IN GAME. (press ENTER at the input tab to create with template)


## Installation

Place file in the following path:

Please ControllerFFB-0X346E0004.ini into:
D:\XGP game\Forza Motorsport\Content\media\base

Please UserRawGameControllerMappingProfile1.xml into:
D:\XGP game\Forza Motorsport\Content\media\base\inputmappingprofiles

In the Advanced Input tab, enable the [INVERT FORCE FEEDBACK] setting.
## Todo

- Premap handbreak and shifter
