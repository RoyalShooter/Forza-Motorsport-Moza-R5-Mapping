# Forza Motorsport Moza R5ES Mapping

A Forza Motorsport input mapping file for Moza R5ES, honestly this should come preinstalled in the game. But since it is not, I decided to create one.

This file is moded from the original R9CS input mapping file to use for R5ES.

Shifter and Handbrake are not mapped for the current file, since I don't have that installed on my rig right now and can't test for it. You can simply map it yourself by creating a new profile with my template IN GAME. (press ENTER at the input tab to create with template)

## mapping:
ABXY and Dpad as default
Special mapping:
PL= Start
Fl= Select
S1= look left
S2= look right
Home= look back


## Installation

Place the file in the following path:

Place ControllerFFB-0X346E0004.ini into:
D:\XGP game\Forza Motorsport\Content\media\base

Place UserRawGameControllerMappingProfile1.xml into:
D:\XGP game\Forza Motorsport\Content\media\base\inputmappingprofiles

In the Advanced Input tab, enable the [INVERT FORCE FEEDBACK] setting.
## Todo

- Premap handbrake and shifter
