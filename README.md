# Forza Motorsport Moza R5ES Mapping

A Forza Motorsport input mapping file for Moza R5ES, honestly this should come preinstalled in the game. But since it is not, I decided to create one.

This file is moded from the original R9CS input mapping file to use with R5ES.

Shifter and Handbrake is not mapped for the current file, since I don't have that installed on my rig right now and can't test for it. You can simply map it yourself by creating a new profile with my template IN GAME. (press ENTER at the input tab to create with template)

## Installation:

Download from the release page

https://github.com/RoyalShooter/Forza-Motorsport-Moza-R5ES-Mapping/releases/tag/latest

1. Place the file in the following path:

> For XGP version:
> 
> Please ControllerFFB-0X346E0004.ini into:
> X:\XGP game\Forza Motorsport\Content\media\base
> 
> Please UserRawGameControllerMappingProfile1.xml into:
> X:\XGP game\Forza Motorsport\Content\media\base\inputmappingprofiles

> For Steam.... it should have something similar, I will update this when I get confirmation from someone with a Steam copy :P

2. In the Advanced Input tab, enable the [INVERT FORCE FEEDBACK] setting.

## Q&A:

*Why is my profile name **InputUINames:<unknown>** ?*

It is normal if the profile name shows as `InputUINames:<unknown>` , since the game is somehow preventing me from adding a new profile directly, I have to modify a blank template to make it work.

*Clutch not working ?*

Well, I have the SRP lite bundle and I don't have a Clutch to test, I just temporarily assigned an axis to hope for the best. I will fix this in the future when I purchase a clutch. For now, you could change the binding yourself with my template by pressing enter on the input page.
